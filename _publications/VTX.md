The Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist VTX-2337 (motolimod) is an anti-cancer immunotherapeutic agent that is believed to augment natural killer (NK) and dendritic cell (DC) activity. The goal of this work is to examine the role of TLR8 expression/activity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to facilitate the prediction of responders to VTX-2337-based therapy. The prognostic role of TLR8 expression in HNSCC patients was assessed by TCGA and tissue microarray analyses. The anti-tumor effect of VTX-2337 was determined in SCCVII/C3H, mEERL/C57Bl/6 and TUBO-human EGFR/BALB/c syngeneic mouse models. The effect of combined VTX-2337 and cetuximab treatment on tumor growth, survival and immune cell recruitment was assessed. TLR8 expression was associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and favorable survival outcomes. VTX-2337 delayed tumor growth in all 3 syngeneic mouse models and significantly increased the survival of cetuximab-treated mice. The anti-tumor effects of VTX-2337+ cetuximab were accompanied by increased splenic lymphoid DCs and IFNÎ³+ CD4+ and tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Depletion of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells were all able to abolish the anti-tumor effect of VTX-2337+ cetuximab. Altogether, VTX-2337 remains promising as an adjuvant for cetuximab-based therapy however patients with high TLR8 expression may be more likely to derive benefit from this drug combination compared to patients with low TLR8 expression.
