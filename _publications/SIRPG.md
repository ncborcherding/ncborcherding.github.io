##Abstract

Multiple GWAS studies have shown that the SNP rs2281808 TT variant, present within the SIRPG gene, is associated with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. However, the role of SIRPŒ≥ in human T-cells is not known, neither is the functional significance of TT variant. Here we investigated SIRPG genotypes and their effects on the fate and function of human T-cells. We found that the presence of T variant resulted in reduction of SIRPŒ≥ expression on T-cells. Functionally, SIRPŒ≥low CD8 T-cells in CT and TT individuals existed in a heightened effector state with lower activation threshold and had greater expression of genes and molecules associated with migratory and cytotoxic potential. Further, SIRPŒ≥low CD8 T-cells were deficient in transcription factors associated with long-term functional memory formation. Our study reveals biological consequences of the SNP rs2281808 and provides novel insights into the potential mechanisms by which SIRPŒ≥ might regulate human immune responses.
