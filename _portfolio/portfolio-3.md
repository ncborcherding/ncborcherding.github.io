This is currently an ongoing project and the analysis and code is located at my [github](https://github.com/ncborcherding/SC_Immune_Renal_Project). We are analyzing CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and myeloid cells from the peripheral-blood and tumoring-infiltrating populations 3 renal clear cell carcinoma patients. Check back soon for a publication link and update.

Abstract
---

Human clear cell renal cell carcinoma is one of the most immunologically distinct tumor types due to high levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells including T cells, yet been associated with poor clinical prognosis. These lymphocytes and myeloid cell populations can exist in a spectrum of discrete states expressing specific gene programs, which might impact tumor growth and clinical outcome. Despite extensive research, the diverse immune cell states within ccRCC tumor microenvironment contributing to this unique tumor type is unknown. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing along with T cell receptor sequencing to study the transcriptomic heterogeneity of 25,688 individual CD45+ lymphoid and myeloid cells in matched tumor and blood from patients with renal clear cell carcinoma. We demonstrate low inter-individual variability that can be explained by extensive overlapping of gene expression profile across three-individuals and further identify 10 T cell phenotypes, 6 myeloid phenotypes, 3 NK and B cell phenotypes; annotated to a range of distinct cell states. We further delineate enriched TCR subclonal structure of T cells that share commonality among different T cell states, but are typically unique to each patient. Here, we define the immune landscape of ccRCC and identify of a variety of lymphoid and myeloid subsets with distinct putative functions. This report represents the first characterization of the immune landscape of ccRCC using single-cell RNA-sequencing. With further characterization and functional validation, these findings may identify novel sub-populations of immune cells amenable to therapeutic intervention.
