This is currently an ongoing project and the analysis and code is located at my [github](https://github.com/ncborcherding/SC_Immune_Renal_Project). We are analyzing CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and myeloid cells from the peripheral-blood and tumoring-infiltrating populations 3 renal clear cell carcinoma patients. Check back soon for a publication link and update.
