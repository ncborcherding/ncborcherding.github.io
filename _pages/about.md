I am in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Iowa. I have just completed my graduate work in Cancer Bioloy with [Weizhou Zhang](https://zhanglab.pathology.ufl.edu/) with a dissertation entitled, "Big Data Analystics and Cancer Biology: Lessons in taking science from the processor to the patient." (link coming soon). My research interest lie in connect data science and medicine, specifically in the field of cancer immunology. Over the course of my graduate work, I have gotten the opportunity to work on projects in the Zhang lab and a number of different labs to organize, process, and analyze transcriptomic and large-scale data. Medically, I am interested in development of processing frameworks for applications in the field of Pathology.
